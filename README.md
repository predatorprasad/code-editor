# React CodePen Clone Project

## Overview
ðŸš€ Welcome to my React CodePen Clone project! This project aims to replicate the functionalities of CodePen, providing a platform for users to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a dynamic and interactive environment.

## Features
- **React Components:** Utilized a component-based architecture to create modular and reusable components, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

- **State Management with Context API:** Implemented the React Context API to manage the state of HTML, CSS, and JS across components. This ensures seamless communication and synchronization of data.

- **Material-UI for Styling:** Enhanced the visual appeal and responsiveness of the application using Material-UI components and styling. The `styled` function provided by Material-UI allowed for elegant and customizable styles.

- **Responsive Design:** Ensured a seamless user experience across various devices by implementing a responsive design. The use of percentages in styling and the `width` and `height` attributes in the `iframe` element contributes to this responsiveness.
